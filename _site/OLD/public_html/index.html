<h1>VTLeaks - Promoting transparency and accountability in Vermont</h1>
<hr>
VTleaks was founded on March 10th 2014 to promote transparency and
accountability in Vermont government, finances, corporations, law enforcement
, jails and prisons. We will be hosting a 
<a href="http://globaleaks.org"> GLobaLeaks </a>
instance to allow
whistleblowers to submit news and documents that will be passed on to
Vermont media. We are actively seeking journalists, legal minds and data 
transparency activists to form a core group.

site to increase organizational transparency.
