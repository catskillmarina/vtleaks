<div id="home">
Currently we are in the process of setting up the infrastructure for recieving
anonymous tips. Once the infrastructure is operational we request you follow
the following submission guidelines.
</p>
<p>
<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li>submissions should be of materials not already publicly available or
        that have been suppressed in some way.</li>
    <li>include a description of the materials and their relevance</li>
    <li>organize the material if possible - zip, tar or 7z archives are
        appreciated</li>
    <li>do not submitt allegations without documentary proof. If you are
        reporting on something you witnessed please include a way for us
        or our media partners to verify what you are reporting.</li>
    <li>Be aware that formats like PDF, word processor documents, images and
        video may contain metadata that can be used to identify you. If you 
        can, scrub metadata. We will do our best to clean documents we recieve
        however it is best that we cannot identify you at all.
</ul>
