  * VT State Police Fail at InfoSec<br/>

On Sept 1 2022 7:25 am according to the timestamp on the following image 
someone requested a password reminder for the mailman listserve server 
that posts to the vtstatepolice blogspot blog. This resulted in the 
email address, username and password for the mailman server to be posted
to the public blog used for VT State Police press releases. The password
has been redacted on this copy.

<p>
The private list information was posted again to the list before the offending
messages were scrubbed from the blog. The messages were no longer visible as
of 9:45 am on Sept 1 2022.

I requested a comment from the VT State Police but they have not responded
as of the time of the publication of this article. I will include their
response when and if they get back to me.
