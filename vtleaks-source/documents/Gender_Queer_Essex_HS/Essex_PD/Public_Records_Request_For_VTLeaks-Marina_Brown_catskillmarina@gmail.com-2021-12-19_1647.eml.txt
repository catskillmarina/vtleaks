I am seeking any and all records from Sept 15 2021 to Dec 1 2021 
regarding calls to the Essex Police Department regarding or involving 
student LGBT* organiations and or books regarding the LGBT* community
at Essex HS.

I was tipped off that multiple people called the police with regards
to a book being read at Essex VT High School and want to find what the
controversy was about for VTLeaks.

Best Regards
