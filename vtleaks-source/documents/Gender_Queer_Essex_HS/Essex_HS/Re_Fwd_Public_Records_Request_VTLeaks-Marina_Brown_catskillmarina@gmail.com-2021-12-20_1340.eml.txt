Yes, emails, memos, phone logs, notes and even recorded phone messages 
complaining about books with LGBT* content. I am looking for any 
complaint or book removal request or complaint about LGBT* books in
the time period between Sept 15 2021 and Dec 1 2021.

Also, identify who you

Principals, librarians and the faculty advisors of LGBT* groups.

I was tipped off that someone called the police about a book that
was being read by a campus LBGT* group. That is the context of this
request.

Thank you for your time and consideration. If phone messages are too 
much of a hassle please exclude them for now.

Sincerely,
