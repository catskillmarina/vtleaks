Dear Mrs Cobb:

I am sorry to take more of your precious time but i have a few questions.

1) Has the complainant showed up at school board meetings ? If so, do 
you recall the dates ?

2) Have there been multiple complainants or just the one ?

3) Have they taken any actions outside of calling the police and 
formally challenging the book ?
