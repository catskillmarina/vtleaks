Dear Essex HS Principles

I am seeking any and all records from Sept 15 2021 to Dec 1 2021
regarding calls to the Essex Police Department regarding or involving
student LGBT* organizations and or books regarding the LGBT* community
at Essex HS.

I am also seeking records of any books challenged in that period by
any person.


Best Regards
