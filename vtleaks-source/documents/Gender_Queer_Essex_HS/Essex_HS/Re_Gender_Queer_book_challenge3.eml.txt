Yes, thank you - i do.

That is correct. I have a copy of the redacted email and the PDF i PRR'd
from The State's Atty office.

What i find interesting about the PDF is that it includes a picture of 
the book in the shelf at the school, the listing in the school computer 
system along with pictures of the book. The complainant stated that they
have the book in their possession.
