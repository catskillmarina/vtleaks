Hi Marina,
1.  No it has not come to a school board meeting.
2. One complaint came to myself and the principals at EHS. We had them go
through the procedure. You should have that email.
3. To my knowledge, the police received an email with a PDF of the book.

Nothing has been done outside of the 2 things I listed above.

Beth
