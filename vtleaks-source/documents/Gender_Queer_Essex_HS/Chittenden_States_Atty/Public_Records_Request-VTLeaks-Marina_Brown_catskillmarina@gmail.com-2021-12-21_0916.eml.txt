Dear Chittenden County States Atty:

Under the Vermont Public Records Law, §315 et seq., I am requesting an 
opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of records regarding complaints
or discussion of complaints of the book 'Gender Queer' or the LGBTQIA* 
club at Essex High School.

Specifically i was tipped off that the police were called regarding this 
book at Essex High School. I am requesting records pertaining to that
incident.

If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please 
inform me if the cost will exceed $20. However, I would also like to 
request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested 
information is in the public interest and will contribute
significantly to the public’s understanding of the the challenges 
Schools and school librarians face today.

I am a citizen journalist who is gathering this information in the 
public interest This information is not being sought for commercial 
purposes however it may be shared with commercial media.

The law requires a response to this request within 2 days, or within 10 
days for extraordinary circumstances. If you expect a significant delay 
in fulfilling this request, please contact me with information about 
when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested 
records. If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each
specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the 
information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under 
the law. Thank you for considering my request.
-- 

Sincerely
Marina Brown
