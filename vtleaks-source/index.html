VTleaks was founded on March 10th 2014 to promote transparency and 
accountability in Vermont government, finances, corporations, law enforcement 
, jails and prisons. We are hosting a GLobaLeaks instance on the TOR anonymity
network to allow whistleblowers to submit news and documents that will be 
passed on to Vermont media. We are actively seeking journalists, legal minds 
and data transparency activists to form a core group.
