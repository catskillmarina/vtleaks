<h2> Organizational Structure</h2>
<p>
VTLeaks shall be composed of 4 core bodies with separate but overlapping duties.
These bodies are as follows.
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#Editorial">Editorial Board</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Technical">Technical Core Group</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Legal">Legal Advisory Group</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Advisory">Advisory Group</a></li>
    <li><a href="#Multiple">Membership in multiple groups</a></li>
</ul>
<br/>
</p>
<h3><a name="Editorial">Editorial Board</a></h3>
<p>
The purpose of the Editorial Board is to analyse any data that is submitted to
VTLeaks with an eye to passing it on to media who will publish it. The 
qualifications needed to be on the Editorial Board is long term knowledge and
experience in media. Good writing skills are not enough one must have experience
with editorial decisions and possibly training as in journalism.  Only if the
data is not accepted and published by established media will we consider 
publishing it on our own. The Editorial Board has the authority to publish 
materials however the Technical Core Group may also vet the material to ensure 
that the anonymity and security of the source and the recipient of the 
materials will not be compromised by publishing the material. If there is any
question about the legal status of the material the Legal Advisory Group should
be consulted. Before providing materials that may be of questionable legality
to any outside group for analysis the Technical Core Group and the Legal 
Advisory Board should be consulted. (We do not want to fall into the same trap 
that Barret Brown fell into.)
</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="Technical">Technical Core Group</a></h3>
<p>
The Technical Core Group is responsible for the technical measures needed to
maintain the anonymity and confidentiality of sources and recipients of data
who need anonymity and confidentiality. 
<br/>
<br/>
Qualifications: Technical Core Group members must 
understand anonymity networks, cryptographic practice, and how to defend from
the attacks against these precautions. They must also have a good 
understanding of basic tradecraft and personal security measures that may need
to be taken by sources and data recipients. 
<br/>
<br/>
Some Technical Core Group members must be able to explain and identify social
engineering and technical attacks that may be used to gain access to networks 
as well as attacks to compromise organization members. It is incumbant upon ALL
people working with the organization to be aware of security issues and how to
secure themselves.
<br/>
<br/>
At least some of the Technical Core Group members must be part of the global 
data transparency and anonymity community and must be able to coordinate with
software producers and other transparency groups to keep the software up to
date and to provide the most secure and anonymous hosting that is practical.
Being part of the global data transparency movement allows the organization
to call upon people with decades of experience running an initiative of this
sort and it provides our organization with global resources in the areas of
security, technology, legislation and legal defenses. In short it would not
be possible to do this without this help.
<br/>
<br/>
The Technical Core Group may recruit outside people for graphic design or 
for other software help if needed, though it must be emphasised that the 
job of the technical group is far beyond that of a webmaster. Helping on a
project does not endow Technical Core Group membership.  Technical Core
Group members must have the full qualifications previously discussed.
</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="Legal">Legal Advisory Group</a></h3>
<p>
The Legal Advisory Group helps advise the organization of any possible legal
problems it may encounter and the best ways to deal with any legal problems.
The qualifications needed are legal training or experience and proven 
understanding of the possible legal issues we may encounter. In todays 
atmosphere it is essential that we be very careful.
</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="Advisory">Advisory Group</a></h3>
<p>
The previous 3 groups discussed are operational groups that require a high
level of a specific skill. The Advisory Group consists of a people who fully
support the mission of the organization which is to promote transparency and
provide a place for anonymous whistleblowing. Members of the advisory group
may have other expertise and contacts that will further the group mission.
</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="Multiple">Membership in Multiple Operational Groups</a></h3>
<p>
People may be members of more than one operational group if they have the
prerequisite qualifications.
</p>
<br/>

<h3><a name="admin">administrative positions or boards</a></h3>
<p>
An administrative board or position may be formed of organizational members 
elected from all other sections of the organization to fulfill any legal or 
functional purpose.  There may be a chair or a spokesperson but these officers 
do not have any authority other than what is strictly given to them by the 
organization. An administrative board has no authority over the organization 
only duties assigned to it. They may not remove other members and they must be 
elected by majority vote. They may NOT change the bylaws and they may not 
elect any so called 'executive boards'.

</ul>

<h2><a name="Format">Meeting Format</a></h2>
<p>
Meetings format is a standard union meeting format. The first matter is 
approving the meeting facilitator. Potential facilitators are presented and
if neccesary, elected. Normally there is little controversy over competent
meeting facilitators.
</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="Agenda">Agenda</a></h3>
<p>
The second matter of any 
meeting is presenting the agenda. An agenda may be presented by any member and 
competing agendas will be consolidated. Before proceeding the agenda must be
voted on. If there is any objections points on the agenda will be discussed
until an agenda is approved by a majority.
</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="Speaking">Speaking</a></h3>
<p>
Agenda items are discussed in the order they are listed. Rounds of speakers are
taken by the facilitator. A person may call a vote. A vote call may itself be
voted on. A vote may not be called until at least 1 round of speakers are 
called. At a vote call a person objecting may raise their hand to put themselves
in stack to oppose. After more speakers are called a person may call a vote on
the vote. You may not do calls on calls to vote. If a meeting is too long 
people can of course call to end the meeting. Note, there is no need for 
'seconds' or stuff like that. Discussion on matters other than the item at hand
may be called 'out of order'. New items may be added to the agenda as needed
during the meeting. Anyone can call to add a new item to the agenda and 
additions may be voted on if neccesary.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Decisions with the exception
of changes to the Bylaws are made by simple democratic vote with the exception
that Technical Group members may veto any action that may compromise the 
anonymity and security of sources, recipients that require anonymity or the
organization as a whole. This is the sole thing Technical group members have a 
veto on. A veto may be overridden only by concensus of the editorial board 
supported by one or more Technical group member. Legal Advisory Group members
may object to actions that may have dire legal consequences beyond that which
we are willing to incur. Their objection requires a 75% supermajority to 
override.
</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="Quorum">Quorum</a></h3>
<p>
Quorum is achieved when at least 50% of the members of operational groups
are present and at least one member of the Editorial Board, Technical Core
Group and Legal Group are present. The operational groups consist of the
Editorial Board, The Technical Core Group and the Legal Group. Decisions may be 
made in face to face meetings, face to face meetings with people participating 
electronically, fully electronically or even by mail or email. Once a quorum 
of people discusses and votes on an issue it is legally decided. Should there 
be controversy on a topic, members can request a face to face meeting or an 
electronic meeting to better discuss the issue.
</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="Notice">Notice</a></h3>
<p>
Notice will be given at least 12 hours in advance of any normal face to face
meetings. Exceptions are if at least 75% of members are notified earlier or an
emergency exists. Notice for electronic decision making is achieved when a 
majority of operational group members have given their vote. Snap decisions
made by a minority of members with little notice to members of operational 
groups are to be avoided when possible.
</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="Notes">Meeting Notes</a></h3>
<p>
A record of meetings shall be maintained. If it is not possible for someone to
keep a full record of the discussion, a record of decisions will be kept as a
'TODO' list.
</p>
<br/>

<h2><a name="Other">Other Policies and Procedures</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Transparency">Transparency</a></h3>
<p>
Financial transactions will be posted publically where possible. This means 
what was spent and what for. It does not necessarily mean that people's 
identities will be revealed. Peoples positions may be revealed if it is
deemed appropriate.
</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="acceptance">Acceptance of Bylaws</a></h3>
<p>
Once the Bylaws are accepted, Bylaw changes may only be done by concensus.
