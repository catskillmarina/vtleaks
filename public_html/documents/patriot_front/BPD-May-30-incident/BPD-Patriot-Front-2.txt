opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of records regarding incidents 
regarding the group ‘Patriot Front’and any incident at 1 North Ave 
between 9:30 and 11:30pm on May 30 2020.

I would strongly prefer that these records be provided in digital format 
or be posted on your transparency page for the public to view directly.

If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please 
inform me if the cost will exceed $20. However, I would also like to 
request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested 
information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly 
to the publics’ understanding of the Vermont policing and Justice system

public interest This information is not being sought for commercial
