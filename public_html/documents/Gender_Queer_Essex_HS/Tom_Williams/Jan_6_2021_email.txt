> The book has been a hot button issue in other States with parents discovering it on the shelves and successfully campaigning to have it removed. Essex High School took a proactive approach and notified all parents of the presence of the book and their justification for having it available to students. When I did my own independent research, I discovered how disturbing the graphical images are and requested from the administration how to file a complaint. They responded professionally and promptly to my request. I have not heard anything else yet about next steps.

If you want to cover this, just do a few minutes of image searching on Google and you will find pictures from this book showing an under-age male giving another male a blow job. I can't believe there is even any debate on an issue like this. It's very simply inappropriate to have that kind of sexually explicit material in any public school.
