> I have not heard of VT Leaks before... My complaint about the pedophilia pornographic drawings in a book in the Essex High School Library isn't a "leak"... it's a matter of public record. If you want to cover this, just do a few minutes of image searching on Google and you will find pictures from this book showing an under-age male giving another male a blow job. I can't believe there is even any debate on an issue like this. It's very simply inappropriate to have that kind of sexually explicit material in any public school.
