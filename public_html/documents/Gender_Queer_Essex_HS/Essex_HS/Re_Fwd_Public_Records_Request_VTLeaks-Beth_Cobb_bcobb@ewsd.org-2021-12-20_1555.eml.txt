Marina,
I have gathered documents for you.  I do not have any phone messages.  It
is not something that our system stores and to my knowledge, there have
been no phone messages regarding the removal of books.

Here is a shared folder
<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1cVHIPiLv2PolSx7T8TPyp3DrTb5NFJdV>
with
documents in it for your viewing.  I have emailed the advisors for their
documents and will add additional materials if I receive anything.  I would
like to make clear that there was not a book read within the LGBTQIA+
Club.

We have had one complaint from a community member and you will find the
complaint email in the folder.  You will also find an email from the Essex
Police Department.  We have not received any other complaints.

I will let you know if I add any more documents.

Beth
